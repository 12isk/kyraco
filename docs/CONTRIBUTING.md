# Contributing

Quick workflow
1. Fork / branch from main: git checkout -b feature/your-feature
2. Implement changes; follow existing style (JSX + CSS modules).
3. Run local dev: npm install && npm run dev
4. Open a PR with description, screenshots, and reproduction steps.

Notes
- Keep server secrets out of commits.
- For API changes, update docs/API.md and tests.
- Add simple tests or instructions to reproduce if the change affects flow (checkout, webhooks).
- If adding new env vars, update docs/ENV.md.

Contact
- Create issues for large changes or deployment questions.
